The Final step in making the PANI PURI,

                            Take the PURI which we have made and put a small hole with our finger in it and add some stuffing inside it.If you want you can add some chopped coriander leaves and SEV(Ompodi) inside the PURI.Then take the filled PURI and Pour some PANI in it.Thats all you have made the delicious "INDIAN CHAT ITEM 'THE PANI PURI'".
